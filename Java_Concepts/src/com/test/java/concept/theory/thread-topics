Mutual Exclusion
================
It ensures that only one thread can execute the 
critical section of a computer program at a time.

To access a critical section, a thread acquires the mutex, 
then accesses the critical section, and finally releases the mutex.

Semaphore 
==========
 is a thread synchronization construct that avoids missed signals between threads 
 by sending signals to the threads and protecting critical sections. 
 
 With the use of counters, Semaphore manages access to the shared resources.
 
 Synchronization
 ================
 the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource. 
 In the Multithreading concept, multiple threads try to access the shared resources
 at a time to produce inconsistent results. 
 The synchronization is necessary for reliable communication between threads.
