Transaction-Isolation
========================
1.Read Committed
2.Read Uncommitted
3.Repeatable Reads
4.Serializable

Syntax: @Transactional(isolation = Isolation.READ_UNCOMMITTED)

Dirty Reads
===========
when a transaction reads data that has been modified by another transaction, 
but not yet committed
For example, suppose transaction 1 updates a row. 
Transaction 2 reads the updated row before transaction 1 commits the update.
Non Repeatable Read
=====================
A non-repeatable read occurs when a transaction reads the same row twice 
but gets different data each time. 
For example, suppose transaction 1 reads a row. 
Transaction 2 updates or deletes that row and commits the update or delete.

Phantom Read
=============
A phantom read can occur when two identical read operations are performed, 
but two different sets of results are returned because an update has occurred 
on the data between the read operations.
For example, if a SELECT is executed twice, but returns a row the second time 
that was not returned the first time, the row is a “phantom” row.

Read Committed
===============
This means the database will not read any of the uncommitted values
Dirty Reads: No 
Non Repeatable Read: Yes
Phantom: Yes

Read Uncommitted
=================
Dirty Reads: Yes
Non Repeatable Read: Yes
Phantom: Yes	

Repeatable Reads
================
Dirty Reads: No
Non Repeatable Read: No
Phantom: Yes

Serializable
============
Dirty Reads: No
Non Repeatable Read: No
Phantom: No
