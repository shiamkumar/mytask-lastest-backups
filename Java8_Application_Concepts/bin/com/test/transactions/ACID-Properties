ACID Properties
===============
Atomicity
=========
This property specifies that every transaction on the database should be 
atomic in nature. The series of commands in a transaction should be executed as a 
single entity and in case of any exception, it should be rolled back as a 
single entity. There should be no state of partial execution of a transaction.

Consistency
===========
It means that the transaction should not violate any of the constraints of the db.

Isolation 
=========
It means that a particular transaction should see itself as the only transaction in the db.
 
Durability
==========
It means the changes done by a particular transaction should be durable and should be
 persistent on the disk.
