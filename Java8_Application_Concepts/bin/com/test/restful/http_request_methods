200 - “Everything is OK.”
=========================
This is the code that is delivered when a web page or resource 
acts exactly the way it's expected to. 

201 - “Created.”
================
The server has fulfilled the browser's request, and as a result, has created a new resource.


400 - Bad Request
==================
Bad Request response status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process 
the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error

401 - Unauthorized Response
===========================
the client request has not been completed because it lacks valid authentication 
credentials for the requested resource

402 - Payment Required
==========================
Payment Required is a nonstandard response status code that is reserved for future use. 
This status code was created to enable digital cash or (micro) payment systems and 
would indicate that the requested content is not available until the client makes a payment.

403 - Forbidden response
========================
indicates that the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.
This status is similar to 401 , but for the 403 Forbidden status code, 
re-authenticating makes no difference. The access is tied to the application logic, 
such as insufficient rights to a resource.

404 - page Not Found
====================
404 is a status code that tells a web user that a requested page is not available. 
404 and other response status codes are part of the web's Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
response codes. The 404 code means that a server could not find a client-requested webpage.
