 OAuth
 ======
 OAuth means open authorization protocol. 
 This protocol allows you to access the client applications on HTTP 
 for third-party providers GitHub, Facebook, etc. 
 It helps you to share resources stored on one site with another site 
 without the need for their credentials.
 
 Advantages of Microservices
 =============================
 1. Easy Deployment 
 2. Require Less Development Effort
 3. Mixed Technical Stack
 4. Independent Development
 5. Improves Workflow
 6. No Dependence On One Technical Slack
 7. Offer Improved Fault Isolation
 
 Limitations of Microservices
 =============================
 1. Building
 2. Testing
 3. Deployment
 4. Logging and Monitoring

API Gateway
===========
=>Single entry point for all clients.
=>API Gateway serves as a reverse proxy to accept API calls from the client application, 
forwarding this traffic to the appropriate service.

Circuit Breaker
===============
=> allows microservices to communicate as usual and monitor the number of failures occurring 
	within the defined time period
=>create resilient microservices by limiting the impact of service failures and latencies.
=>It can allow a microservice to continue operating when a related service fails, 
preventing the failure from cascading and giving the failing service time to recover

Load Balancer
=============
=>It serves as the single point of contact for clients.
=>A load balancer acts as the “traffic cop” sitting in front of your servers and routing
 client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that 
 maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked, 
 which could degrade performance.
 =>Application Load Balancers, and Network Load Balancers.
 
 Config Server
 =============
 =>Central configuration server provides configurations (properties) to each micro service connected.
 =>The Config Server can be used to communicate with different Config Stores one at a time or all at the same time.
 
 discovery
 ==========
 =>A client-side discovery pattern searches the service registry to locate a service provider, 
 selects an appropriate and available service instance using a load balancing algorithm, 
 and then makes a request.
 =>In a server-side discovery pattern, the router searches the service registry and, 
 once the applicable service instance is found, forwards the request accordingly.
 
 API gateway
 ===========
 An API gateway is an API management tool that sits between a client and a collection of
 backend services. An API gateway acts as a reverse proxy to accept all application programming
 interface (API) calls, aggregate the various services required to fulfill them, and return the appropriate result.
